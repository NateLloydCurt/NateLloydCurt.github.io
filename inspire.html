        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>In recnet times I think a great modenr day hero is Blake Mycoskie. He is the creator of TOMS and uses his company to help those in need. Whenever someone buys a pair of his shoes he donates a pair to someone in need.</p>
